## Introduction
YouTubePlus ("we", "our", or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## Information We Collect
YouTubePlus does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal user data to our servers. All operations are performed locally on your device or directly via the official YouTube Data API.

To function, the extension requires access to:

This access is strictly for the purpose of adding videos to your playlist and closing tabs as requested by you. We do not track your watch history or view habits.

### 2. Authentication Data
We use Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication. Your access token is stored locally on your device (`storage.local`) to maintain your session and is used solely to authorize requests to the YouTube API on your behalf.

## How We Use Your Information
- **Playlist Management:** To add videos to your private "My Watch Later" playlist.
- **Tab Management:** To close tabs after successful playlist addition.

## Third-Party Services
- **Google/YouTube:** We interact directly with Google services. Please review [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information.
